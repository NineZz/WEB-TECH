            A duck walked up to a lemonade stand<br>
            And he said to the man runnin' the stand<br>
            "Hey! [(bam bam bam)] Got any grapes?"<br>
            The man said: "No, we just sell lemonade<br>
            But it's cold, and it's fresh, and it's all home-made!<br>
            Can I get you a glass?"<br>
            The duck said, "I'll pass."<br>
